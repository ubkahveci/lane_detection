Autonomous driving has been something that attracted my interest for quite sometime. I have always dreamed that people would get in their cars and just select the destination and the car would do the rest. I have done a loot of signal and image processing for my Masters thesis and that knowledge has led me to analyzing dashcam videos to detect surrounding objects for autonomous driving.  

This is a primitive attempt to detect lanes from videos obtained from dashcams.

Future works to be done;

* Show average lanes for a better visual(not all detected lanes)
* Show pedestrian lanes in a different color
* Detect any vehicle or pedestrian on the detected lane
